# Welcome to the CalArchNet information site!
 
## The California Architecture Network (CalArchNet) 
 
### Purpose
Founded in 2016, CalArchNet (pronounced Cal-Ark-Net) is comprised of library, archive, and museum professionals who collect, organize, describe, preserve, promote, interpret, exhibit, and provide access to records about the built environment in California. CalArchNet provides a twice-yearly forum so this group of professionals may:
Learn more about California architecture 
Understand the ways California architecture records are used  
Share information and expertise
Seek advice
Build a community committed to standard practices that improve operations and services, and bring greater visibility to collections and programs
 
### Goals
CalArchNet is currently focused exposing California architecture collections and making them easier for researchers at all levels to find. Leveraging existing platforms like the Online Archive of California (OAC) and creating basic records for collections without finding aids are ways CalArchNet is working to make California architectural records more discoverable. 
 
### Participating  
If you work in a library, archives, or museum with architectural records and you would like to join a community working towards these aims and more, simply contact calarchnet@gmail.com or join our [Link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/calarchnet) Google Group. 
 
### Next Meeting
