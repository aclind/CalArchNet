# 1/24/18 Invitation:

Dear colleagues,


Final planning is underway for 4th CalArchNet meeting, which will take place on Friday, March 30th (and possibly Saturday, March 31st) in San Luis Obispo and points north. 


# Rough Schedule 

Friday

Hearst Castle - talks, behind-the-scenes tour, Julia Morgan drawings (the tour bus will leave promptly at 9 a.m. from the Visitor Center, so staying in SLO county on Thursday night is highly recommended)
Lunch at Centrally Grown  
Arrive at Cal Poly Special Collections and Archives
Discussion session 
View examples from the architecture collections, including Julia Morgan, William F. Cody and Mark Mills, and even artists' books that relate to architecture and space
Architecture faculty will talk about using the collections in the classroom and beyond
View the Special Collections exhibit on the history of the built environment at Cal Poly, featuring work by students in the College of Architecture and Environmental Design
Light reception

Saturday
Architectural walking tour of San Luis Obispo (map will be provided of other buildings of interest)

I will send out more details, including information about lodging, dining, and other activities, but I need to get a headcount. Because the walking tour would be lead by a member of the SLO City Cultural Heritage Board, I need to ensure that we have enough people to justify making additional arrangements. Please reply to this email by including your name and institution, and if you will be:

Joining us on Friday, March 30th? 
Joining us on Saturday, March 31st?
Will not be joining us this for this meeting
