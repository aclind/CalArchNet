## 1/24/18 Invitation:

Dear colleagues,

Final planning is underway for 4th CalArchNet meeting, which will take place on Friday, March 30th (and possibly Saturday, March 31st) in San Luis Obispo and points north. 

### Rough Schedule 

### Friday

Hearst Castle - talks, behind-the-scenes tour, Julia Morgan drawings (the tour bus will leave promptly at 9 a.m. from the Visitor Center, so staying in SLO county on Thursday night is highly recommended)
Lunch at Centrally Grown  
Arrive at Cal Poly Special Collections and Archives
Discussion session 
View examples from the architecture collections, including Julia Morgan, William F. Cody and Mark Mills, and even artists' books that relate to architecture and space
Architecture faculty will talk about using the collections in the classroom and beyond
View the Special Collections exhibit on the history of the built environment at Cal Poly, featuring work by students in the College of Architecture and Environmental Design
Light reception

### Saturday
Architectural walking tour of San Luis Obispo (map will be provided of other buildings of interest)

I will send out more details, including information about lodging, dining, and other activities, but I need to get a headcount. Because the walking tour would be lead by a member of the SLO City Cultural Heritage Board, I need to ensure that we have enough people to justify making additional arrangements. Please reply to this email by including your name and institution, and if you will be:

Joining us on Friday, March 30th? 
Joining us on Saturday, March 31st?
Will not be joining us this for this meeting

## 2/2/18 Follow-Up:

Dear colleagues: 

For those of you who are planning to attend the 4th CalArchNet meeting, I have attached some details to help you plan your time on the Central Coast. 

Please note that everyone will meet at the Hearst Castle Visitor Center on the morning of Friday, March 30th. I wish we had a giant state vehicle to get us there from Cal Poly, but no beans, I'm afraid. I have included some driving times from San Simeon, Cambria, and San Luis Obispo, places to which I provide lodging links. I can't underscore enough how important it will be to plan plenty of time to drive to the Visitor Center and arrive early. The tour bus will leave promptly at 9 a.m. No late arrivals. 

If you have questions at this stage, please let me know. I will be sending a final schedule and more information about campus parking to all those who  RSVP.

If you haven't RSVPd and would like to, please reply to this email and let me know if you will be joining us!
